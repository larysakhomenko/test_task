Hello, Yanina.
You can find the implementation of the first function and tests for this function in the files "findMultipliers.js" and "findMultipliers.test.js".
You can find the implementation of the second function and tests for this function in the files "detectPalindrome.js" and "detectPalindrome.test.js".
Here is the link to the execution of the third task: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WX7UeBgaEELK06ebGtSqnHVRQkQvEGFH61pavNAfhzQ/edit?usp=sharing.
I consider the first bug I have reported critical because "Qwerty123" is one of the most popular passwords in the world. An Account of a user who used such a password during the registration could be hacked. Password checking for weaknesses will protect clients from possible hacker attacks.
In my mind, the second bug is critical because users in Ukraine cannot complete the registration via mobile phone and use the features of the website. Also, registration cannot be completed by email since no email has been received.
